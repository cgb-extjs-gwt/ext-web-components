## Appendix

### Installing Node and NPM

You can check the version of node you have installed by running:

```
node --version
```

 To install node on Mac OS and Linux, we recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation).  If you already have nvm installed, you can install the latest stable version of Node and NPM using:

 ```
 nvm install stable
 ```

 On Windows you can use the [official installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).  There is also a version of [nvm for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

### Installing Java

In order to install Ext's webpack plugin on Linux, Java 8 must first be installed.

You can check which version of Java you have installed by running:

```
java -version
```

On Debian-based platforms, you can install OpenJDK using:

```
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
```
